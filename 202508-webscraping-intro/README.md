# Introductory Webscraping Project
### August 2025

## Description
This project served as my introduction to webscraping, where I built two webscrapers for the site scrapethissite.com, and put the data I scraped into a .csv file. For the first part of my project, I scraped a page containing Country data, where I scraped the country names as well as their respective data (size, population, etc.). For the second part, I scraped hockey data, which consisted of different NHL teams' records over previous seasons. The second part of the project introduced paginations, which I had to include in my scraper. 

## Project Insights
While this project was introductory and thus fairly simple, this was my first exposure to html, which I learned quite a bit about. It was also my first time using the BeautifulSoup library for Python, which I learned quite a bit about as well. While I worked with greater complexity by including paginations for the second part of my project, future projects in webscraping should definitely incorporate more complexity.
